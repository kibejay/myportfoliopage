            <h2>Android task monitoring</h2>
            <p>This project is exclusively designed to simplify the tracking and monitoring of day-to-day activities of busy modern life. We are so busy in our daily lives right now that it becomes impossible to keep track of our daily events, meetings, and appointments. To address this issue, this project focuses on developing a Weekly Task Alerting System for Android devices that can alert users of the tasks/appointments that are scheduled for each day of the week. 

              The project is primarily a reminder app powered by an AI chatbot that reminds users of all the tasks that are due daily. Users can use this application to set goals and achieve them, thereby increasing productivity and simplifying their lives.</p>

            <h2>Fingerprint-based ATM system</h2>
            <p>In this project, you will develop a fingerprint-based voting application that can recognize users based on their fingerprint patterns. Since fingerprint authentication is unique for each person, the system can quickly identify the voters using their fingerprints. Naturally, a voter can vote for a candidate only once.

              The Admin adds all the names and photos of the candidates nominated for the election. The Admin then authenticates users by verifying their identity proof, and after verification, the voter is registered in the system. Furthermore, the Admin even enters the data when the election will end, after which the system will automatically delete the names and photos of the candidates and voters.</p>

            <h2>Advanced employee management system</h2>
            <p>Usually, large companies and organizations have a vast army of human resources working under them. In such scenarios where there’s a significant number of human employees to manage, it becomes challenging to supervise and manage the activities of the human resources efficiently. Such companies/organizations need an advanced employee management system that can handle everything related to the company’s human resources</p>

            <h2>Android local train ticketing system</h2>
            <p>In this project, you will develop a ticketing application for local trains. Users can use the app to book tickets for local trains and receive online booking receipts. They can print these online booking receipts as a hard copy proof for traveling via local trains. 

              The application consists of two accounts – Admin account and User account. Using the Admin account, the Admin can recharge the user account balance and view all the processed tickets of a user. When users log in to the application, they have to fill a ticket booking form to book tickets for the local trains traveling to their preferred destination.
              
              In the booking form, users can t choose both the source and destination. The system will also provide the option for a single-route journey or return journey along with the travel class (first class or second class). </p>

        <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
        <p>Tech Jay is both a software engineer and a front-end developer, with a diverse range of skills including React, Flutter, Python, Java, and TypeScript.

          The website is personal, leaning heavily into the programmer aesthetic, including a dark-theme with faint integrated development environment (IDE) code in the background. Subtle animations encourage visitors to scroll down the page through a gallery of skills and past work.
          
          One key thing to notice is how the portfolio includes a lot of past projects. Instead of using a generic collage of projects, Tamal Sen shows off UX skills by highlighting a featured project first and varying the sizes of project screenshots for past work.</p>
